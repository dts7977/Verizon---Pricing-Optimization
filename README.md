# Verizon---Pricing-Optimization

Verizon sells cell phone service, internet access, and FIOS TV service to customers.
Customers can buy any combination of these three services (or not buy any). The marketing
manager is trying to determine how to price these services.

Different people/families have different needs and they value these services differently. For
example, some people value TV services more than internet access, while others may value
internet access more than TV services. How can the marketing manager determine profitmaximizing prices for this situation?
Verizon has three strategies available.

• No Bundling: With this strategy Verizon charges a price for cell phone service, a
price for internet access, and a price for TV service. A consumer who wants to buy
more than one services need to purchase them separately.

• Mixed Bundling: With this strategy Verizon comes up with a price for each of the
following seven available combinations:
– Internet
– TV
– Cell Phone
– Internet and TV
– Internet and Cell Phone
– TV and Cell Phone
– TV, Cell Phone, and Internet

• Pure Bundling: With this strategy, all Verizon offers is a pure bundle of TV, Cell
Phone, and Internet services.
